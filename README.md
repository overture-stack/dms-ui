This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This app has been tested using NodeJS version ^16, and it may not work correctly on versions <14.

We strongly recommend using the supported version.

### Development Setup

Setting up the project, and running a development server

```bash
# 1. install the dependencies
  npm ci

# 2. serve the application
  npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This app has been tested using Node v16+. We recommend using this version if you encounter any issues.

### Troubleshooting Note:

DMS-UI requires NPM v^8.3.0, to ensure all dependencies are installed correctly

```bash
# If you need to update your NPM version first, use the following command:
  npm i -g npm
```
