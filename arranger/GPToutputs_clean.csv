The sample size was 70 (nirogacestat) vs. 72 (placebo). The primary outcome was progression-free survival, which showed significant benefits with nirogacestat (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.15 to 0.55; P<0.001).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36884323
Treatment Strategy for Rifampin-Susceptible Tuberculosis.,2023,Nicholas I Paton et al.,674,Standard treatment vs. Rifampin-linezolid strategy vs. Bedaquiline-linezolid strategy,Unspecified,"Composite of death, ongoing treatment, or active disease at week 96","7 of the 181 participants (3.9%) in the standard-treatment group, 21 of the 184 participants (11.4%) in the strategy group with an initial rifampin-linezolid regimen, and 11 of the 189 participants (5.8%) in the strategy group with an initial bedaquiline-linezolid regimen",A strategy involving initial treatment with an 8-week bedaquiline-linezolid regimen was noninferior to standard treatment for tuberculosis with respect to clinical outcomes.,"This open-label, noninferiority trial studied 674 participants with rifampin-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis. Participants were randomly assigned to either a standard treatment of rifampin and isoniazid for 24 weeks with pyrazinamide and ethambutol for the first 8 weeks or a strategy involving initial treatment with an 8-week regimen. The primary outcome was a composite of death, ongoing treatment, or active disease at week 96. Results showed that the strategy involving initial treatment with an 8-week bedaquiline-linezolid regimen was noninferior to standard treatment for tuberculosis with respect to clinical outcomes, with a shorter total duration of treatment and no evident safety concerns.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36808186
