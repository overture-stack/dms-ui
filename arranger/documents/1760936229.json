  "primaryOutcomeResults": "3.6% in the tranexamic acid group and 4.3% in the placebo group (adjusted relative risk, 0.89; 95.26% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 1.07; P = 0.19)",
  "conclusion": "Prophylactic use of tranexamic acid during cesarean delivery did not lead to a significantly lower risk of a composite outcome of maternal death or blood transfusion than placebo.",
  "gPTSummary": "This randomized clinical trial of 11,000 participants with unspecified blinding compared the use of tranexamic acid to placebo for cesarean delivery. The primary outcome was a composite of maternal death or blood transfusion by hospital discharge or 7 days post partum. The results showed that 3.6% of the tranexamic acid group and 4.3% of the placebo group experienced the primary outcome (adjusted relative risk, 0.89; 95.26% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 1.07; P = 0.19).",
