  "primaryOutcome": "Investigator-assessed time-normalised number of hereditary angioedema attacks (number of hereditary angioedema attacks per month) during the 6-month treatment period (day 1 to day 182)",
  "primaryOutcomeResults": "Mean number of hereditary angioedema attacks per month was significantly lower in the garadacimab group (0¬∑27, 95% CI 0¬∑05 to 0¬∑49) than in the placebo group (2¬∑01, 1¬∑44 to 2¬∑57; p<0¬∑0001)",
  "conclusion": "Monthly garadacimab administration significantly reduced hereditary angioedema attacks in patients aged 12 years and older compared with placebo and had a favourable safety profile.",

The primary endpoint was the investigator-assessed time-normalised number of hereditary angioedema attacks (number of hereditary angioedema attacks per month) during the 6-month treatment period. Results showed that the mean number of hereditary angioedema attacks per month was significantly lower in the garadacimab group (0¬∑27, 95% CI 0¬∑05 to 0¬∑49) than in the placebo group (2¬∑01, 1¬∑44 to 2¬∑57; p<0¬∑0001).",
