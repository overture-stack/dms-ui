  "primaryOutcomeResults": "57% of participants who received baricitinib 4 mg reached SRI-4 response compared with 46% of participants who received placebo (odds ratio 1¬∑57 [95% CI 1¬∑09 to 2¬∑27]; difference with placebo 10¬∑8 [2¬∑0 to 19¬∑6]; p=0¬∑016)",
  "conclusion": "Baricitinib 4 mg was more effective than placebo in helping patients with active SLE reach an SRI-4 response at week 52.",
  "gPTSummary": "This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study of 760 patients with active SLE receiving either baricitinib 4 mg, baricitinib 2 mg, or placebo once daily for 52 weeks. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients reaching an SLE Responder Index (SRI)-4 response at week 52, which was 57% in the baricitinib 4 mg group compared with 46% in the placebo group (odds ratio 1¬∑57 [95% CI 1¬∑09 to 2¬∑27]; difference with placebo 10¬∑8 [2¬∑0 to 19¬∑6]; p=0¬∑016).",
