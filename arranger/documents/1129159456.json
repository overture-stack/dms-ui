  "conclusion": "Targeted inhibition of APOL1 channel function with inaxaplin reduced proteinuria in participants with two APOL1 variants and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.",
  "gPTSummary": "This was a single-group, open-label, phase 2a clinical study with an unspecified blinding and a sample size of 16. The patient population was those with two APOL1 variants, biopsy-proven focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and proteinuria. The primary outcome was the percent change from the baseline urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio at week 13, and the findings showed a mean change of -47.6% (95% confidence interval, -60.0 to -31.3).",
