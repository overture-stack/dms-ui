  "primaryOutcome": "Proportion of participants prescribed all 3 groups of recommended therapies at 6 to 12 months after enrollment",
  "primaryOutcomeResults": "Intervention group (37.9%) vs Usual Care group (14.5%), a difference of 23.4% (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 4.38 [95% CI, 2.49 to 7.71]; P < .001)",
  "conclusion": "A coordinated, multifaceted intervention increased prescription of 3 groups of evidence-based therapies in adults with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.",
  "gPTSummary": "This was a cluster randomized clinical trial with 43 US cardiology clinics that recruited 1049 adults with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The intervention group (n=459) received assessment, education, and feedback while the usual care group (n=590) received care per practice guidelines. Results showed that the intervention group was more likely to be prescribed all 3 therapies (37.9%) compared to the usual care group (14.5%), a difference of 23.4%. The intervention was not associated with changes in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors.",
