  "primaryOutcome": "Biochemically verified abstinence and treatment uptake at 1 month after randomization",
  "primaryOutcomeResults": "Opt-out group had 22% vs 16% at month 1 and 19% vs 18% at 6 months. Treatment use for the opt-out group vs the opt-in group was 60% vs 34% for postdischarge cessation medication and 89% vs 37% for completing at least 1 postdischarge counseling call.",
  "conclusion": "Opt-out care doubled treatment engagement and increased quit attempts, while enhancing patients' sense of agency and alliance with practitioners.",
  "gPTSummary": "This randomized clinical trial of 1000 adult patients at a tertiary care hospital in Kansas City compared opt-out care vs opt-in care for people who use tobacco. The primary outcome was biochemically verified abstinence and treatment uptake at 1 month after randomization. Results showed that opt-out care had 22% vs 16% at month 1 and 19% vs 18% at 6 months, and treatment use for the opt-out group vs the opt-in group was 60% vs 34% for postdischarge cessation medication and 89% vs 37% for completing at least 1 postdischarge counseling call. The study was unblinded and concluded that opt-out care doubled treatment engagement and increased quit attempts, while enhancing patients' sense of agency and alliance with practitioners.",
