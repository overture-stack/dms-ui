  "primaryOutcome": "Composite of death, ongoing treatment, or active disease at week 96",
  "primaryOutcomeResults": "7 of the 181 participants (3.9%) in the standard-treatment group, 21 of the 184 participants (11.4%) in the strategy group with an initial rifampin-linezolid regimen, and 11 of the 189 participants (5.8%) in the strategy group with an initial bedaquiline-linezolid regimen",
  "conclusion": "A strategy involving initial treatment with an 8-week bedaquiline-linezolid regimen was noninferior to standard treatment for tuberculosis with respect to clinical outcomes.",
  "gPTSummary": "This open-label, noninferiority trial studied 674 participants with rifampin-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis. Participants were randomly assigned to either a standard treatment of rifampin and isoniazid for 24 weeks with pyrazinamide and ethambutol for the first 8 weeks or a strategy involving initial treatment with an 8-week regimen. The primary outcome was a composite of death, ongoing treatment, or active disease at week 96. Results showed that the strategy involving initial treatment with an 8-week bedaquiline-linezolid regimen was noninferior to standard treatment for tuberculosis with respect to clinical outcomes, with a shorter total duration of treatment and no evident safety concerns.",
