  "primaryOutcomeResults": "Median overall survival was 37.9 months with panitumumab vs 34.3 months with bevacizumab in participants with left-sided tumors (hazard ratio [HR] for death, 0.82; 95.798% CI, 0.68-0.99; P = .03) and 36.2 vs 31.3 months, respectively, in the overall population (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72-0.98; P = .03).",
  "conclusion": "Adding panitumumab to standard first-line chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival in those with left-sided tumors and in the overall population.",
  "gPTSummary": "This randomized, open-label, phase 3 clinical trial conducted at 197 sites in Japan among 823 patients with chemotherapy-naive RAS wild-type, unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer compared the effects of adding panitumumab (an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody) vs bevacizumab (an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody) to standard first-line chemotherapy. The study found that overall survival was significantly improved with panitumumab compared to bevacizumab in both left-sided tumors (hazard ratio [HR] for death, 0.82; 95.798% CI, 0.68-0.99; P = .03) and the overall population (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72-0.98; P = .03).",
