  "primaryOutcomeResults": "Median organ support-free days of 10 (-1 to 16) for ACE inhibitor, 8 (-1 to 17) for ARB, and 12 (0 to 17) for control (median adjusted odds ratios of 0.77 [95% bayesian credible interval, 0.58-1.06] for improvement for ACE inhibitor and 0.76 [95% credible interval, 0.56-1.05] for ARB compared with control)",
  "conclusion": "Initiation of an ACE inhibitor or ARB did not improve, and likely worsened, clinical outcomes in critically ill adults with COVID-19.",
  "gPTSummary": "This randomized clinical trial of 779 hospitalized adults with COVID-19 (721 critically ill and 58 non-critically ill) with an unspecified study blinding examined the effects of initiating an ACE inhibitor or ARB on organ support-free days. The results showed that ACE inhibitors and ARBs did not improve, and likely worsened, clinical outcomes in critically ill adults with COVID-19 (median adjusted odds ratios of 0.77 [95% bayesian credible interval, 0.58-1.06] for improvement for ACE inhibitor and 0.76 [95% credible interval, 0.56-1.05] for ARB compared with control).",
