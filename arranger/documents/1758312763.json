  "gPTSummary": "This double-blind phase 3 trial included 7358 participants (3682 pregnant women and 3558 infants) from 18 countries. The comparison groups were RSVpreF vaccine vs. placebo. The primary outcome was medically attended severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness. Results showed vaccine efficacy of 81.8% (99.5% CI, 40.6 to 96.3) within 90 days after birth and 69.4% (97.58% CI, 44.3 to 84.1) within 180 days after birth, and no safety concerns were identified.",
