  "primaryOutcomeResults": "Blood pressure response to different treatments varied considerably between individuals (P < .001), with an additional 4.4 mm Hg-lower systolic blood pressure on average.",
  "conclusion": "Blood pressure response to drug therapy for hypertension varies significantly between individuals, which may have implications for personalized therapy.",
  "gPTSummary": "This randomized, double-blind, repeated crossover trial of 280 men and women with grade 1 hypertension at low risk for cardiovascular events in Sweden found that blood pressure response to drug therapy for hypertension varies significantly between individuals, with an additional 4.4 mm Hg-lower systolic blood pressure on average. This finding may have implications for personalized therapy.",
