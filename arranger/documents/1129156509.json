  "conclusion": "Calorie restriction resulted in significantly more weight loss than a usual diet.",
  "gPTSummary": "This was a 2-year clinical trial of 218 participants that compared the effects of calorie restriction versus a usual diet on body weight. Unspecified blinding was used. Calorie restriction resulted in an average weight loss of 7.7 kg (17 lbs) compared to a 0.4 kg (0.9 lbs) weight loss in the usual diet group, indicating that calorie restriction is a more effective way to lose weight.",
