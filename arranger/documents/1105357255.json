  "primaryOutcomeResults": "177 patients (8.1%) in the treat-to-target group and 190 patients (8.7%) in the high-intensity statin group (absolute difference, -0.6 percentage points [upper boundary of the 1-sided 97.5% CI, 1.1 percentage points]; P < .001 for noninferiority)",
  "conclusion": "A treat-to-target LDL-C strategy of 50 to 70 mg/dL as the goal was noninferior to a high-intensity statin therapy for the 3-year composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary revascularization.",
  "gPTSummary": "This randomized, multicenter, noninferiority trial in 4400 patients with coronary artery disease treated at 12 centers in South Korea compared a treat-to-target LDL-C strategy of 50 to 70 mg/dL as the goal with a high-intensity statin therapy for the 3-year composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary revascularization. The primary end point occurred in 177 patients (8.1%) in the treat-to-target group and 190 patients (8.7%) in the high-intensity statin group (absolute difference, -0.6 percentage points [upper boundary of the 1-sided 97.5% CI, 1.1 percentage points]; P < .001 for noninferiority).",
