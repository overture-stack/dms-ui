  "blinding": "Unspecified",
  "primaryOutcome": "Adverse pregnancy outcome (fetal loss, adverse newborn baby outcomes, or neonatal death)",
  "primaryOutcomeResults": "Adverse pregnancy outcome was reported more frequently in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group (27.9%) and in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus azithromycin group (27.6%) compared to the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine group (23.3%)",
  "conclusion": "Monthly IPTp with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine did not improve pregnancy outcomes, and the addition of a single course of azithromycin did not enhance the effect of monthly IPTp with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine.",
  "gPTSummary": "This double-blind, three-arm, partly placebo-controlled trial included 4680 HIV-negative pregnant women in Kenya, Malawi, and Tanzania. The study compared IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, IPTp with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus a single treatment course of placebo, or IPTp with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus a single treatment course of azithromycin. The primary outcome was adverse pregnancy outcome, which was reported more frequently in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group (27.9%) and in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus azithromycin group (27.6%) compared to the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine group (23.3%).",
