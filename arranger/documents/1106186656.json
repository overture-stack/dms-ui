  "primaryOutcome": "Progression-free survival",
  "primaryOutcomeResults": "Nirogacestat had a significant progression-free survival benefit over placebo (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.15 to 0.55; P<0.001); the likelihood of being event-free at 2 years was 76% with nirogacestat and 44% with placebo.",
  "conclusion": "Nirogacestat was associated with significant benefits with respect to progression-free survival, objective response, pain, symptom burden, physical functioning, role functioning, and health-related quality of life in adults with progressing desmoid tumors.",
  "gPTSummary": "This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial of nirogacestat in adults with progressing desmoid tumors. The sample size was 70 (nirogacestat) vs. 72 (placebo). The primary outcome was progression-free survival, which showed significant benefits with nirogacestat (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.15 to 0.55; P<0.001).",
